We created the touch system call in sysfile.c, based on touch in UNIX.
It creates an empty file, which is named by the single user argument passed in.
It is useful when a user doesn't have data to store yet but needs to create the file.
The system call will check if the file already exists as to not overwrite existing data.
If the file does not exist, create will make the file and iunlockput is used to unlock the file.
