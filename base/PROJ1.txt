STATUS OF IMPLEMENTATION:
Complete, with extra credit (see last section for explanation).

WORK COMPLETED:
Clay: 
shutdown2 syscall

Alex:
mkdir2 syscall
git repo setup

Michael:
exit2 syscall

As a group:
touch syscall

DESCRIPTION OF HOW CODE WORKS:
shutdown2 syscall: Works identical to the first shutdown, 
with the addition of needing to get the user's message off of the trap frame.
This is then printed in kernel space before the program shuts down.

mkdir2 syscall:

exit2 syscall:



Simple working test cases:
shutdown2 hello world
exit 1
mkdir2 hello world 
...
and many more. All syscalls work as laid out in document specs

EXTRA CREDIT:
We created the touch system call in sysfile.c, based on touch in UNIX.
It creates an empty file, which is named by the single user argument passed in.
It is useful when a user doesn't have data to store yet but needs to create the file.
The system call will check if the file already exists as to not overwrite existing data.
If the file does not exist, create will make the file and iunlockput is used to unlock the file.
