We created the touch system call in sysfile.c, based on touch in UNIX.
It creates an empty file named based on a single argument passed in.
It is useful when a user doesn't have data to store yet but needs to create the file.
The system call will check if the file already exists as to not overwrite existing data
if the file does not exist create will make the file and iunlockput is used to unlock the file.
